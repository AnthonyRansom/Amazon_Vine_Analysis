### Purpose

 - There is a total of 40,471 unpaid reviews by the general public along with 94 reviews by paid vine members
 - There is a total of 15,663 five star rating by the general public along with 48 review by paid vine members
 - The data showed 51% of the public rated products as five stars compared to 39% of paid vine members that rated products as five stars

## Summary

### Positivity Bias

Looking at the results of the analysis there is a large difference in the number of review done by the general public compared to vine users which may skew the data but comparing the number of 5 star reviews where 51% of the general public left five star reviews compared to 39% of vine members would indicate there is no positivity bias for the reviews of the Amazon US Video Games dataset.

### Additional Analysis

An additional analysis can be done to run the analysis only on verified purchases to filter out any false positive/negative reviews done by the general public who have not purchased the product being reviewed to further support this analysis.
